# Mushroom-Predictor
Predicting if a set of mushrooms is edible or not corresponds to the task of classifying them into two groups—edible or poisonous—on the basis of a classification rule. To support this binary task, I have collected the largest and most comprehensive attribute based data available. In the work, we detail the creation, curation and simulation of a data set for binary classification. We evaluated different machine learning algorithms, namely, naive Bayes, logistic regression,KNN, Random forest, decision tree and stochastic gradient method. The data set contains 23 families and is the largest available. I further provide a fully reproducible workflow and provide the data under the FAIR principles.
